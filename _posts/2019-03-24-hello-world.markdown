My programming journey started about 6 months ago when I started by learning some HTML and CSS on Codecademy. This quickly became a bit boring and I felt I wanted to do some “real” programming. Python was suggested to me as a good starter language so I started learning that with Treehouse. I was also given a programming book aimed at children called “Get Coding” for Christmas which was a surprisingly good book helping to teach me HTML and CSS. 

I’m now hoping to move forward in my learning journey by further developing my HTML and CSS skills. I intend to put all my skills together by making a working web page. I am also starting to learn a new language, C#, which will allow me to work on building more interesting projects and improve my employability. 

My plan is to update this blog regularly as I learn new skills and work on new projects so that I can look back on my journey and maybe one day inspire somebody else to have a go at programming too.
