I recently starting learning C# alongside my “starter language” of Python. I chose C# as it is a popular, object-oriented, general purpose language that many organisations use. I have been using .NET core which is able to run on multiple platforms, such as my Mac.

I found learning a second language much easier than learning my first as I understood things such as loops, if statements and functions from learning Python and the concepts were transferable over to C#, I just had to learn the new syntax.

A difference between C# and Python is that unlike Python’s dynamic typing C# uses static typing, meaning you have to declare types when defining variables and methods. A new concept to me was namespaces which C# uses to organise code. You can also use built in namespaces, such as System, which contains code that interacts with the operating system. I struggled at first with the concept of a void method, until I realised that it just meant that the method didn't return anything. Another difference is that C# is a compiled language, so you have to compile using dotnet build, before you can run it. This was different to Python, which is an interpreted language.

Despite it feeling like a considerable jump from Python, I have enjoyed using C#. The syntax is very elegant and the use of curly braces makes it easy to section off parts of code. C# also benefits from being able to use the many built in features of the .NET framework which I am sure I will explore more as I progress with learning C#.
