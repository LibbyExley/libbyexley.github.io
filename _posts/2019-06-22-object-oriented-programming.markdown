A few months ago I began learning Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and it did not come to me easily. Despite programming for around 9 months now, OOP was by far the hardest challenge I had faced. However, OOP is the way that most companies build their software as it is a very good way to write and maintain systems that are large and complex as it groups code into classes rather than one large block. 

I tried many methods to try and learn Object Oriented Programming. I read articles and books, watched youtube videos, asked fellow programmers, did online courses but nothing was really sticking. It turned out I just needed to repeat that process a couple of times and thankfully I have grasped it! I grasped the imperative programming paradigm fairly quickly and going from that to the Object Oriented programming paradigm felt like a large jump. Now I have grasped OOP I do find it useful to be able to organise my code into classes.
