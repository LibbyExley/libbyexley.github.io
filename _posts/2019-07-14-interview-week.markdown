After months of preparation, last week was _the_ week: interview week. I’d been researching junior roles, courses and the best way to get my foot into the door as a developer when I came across degree apprenticeships. 

This program means working full-time for an employer and earning a salary whilst studying for a degree from Sheffield Hallam University. Rather than most apprenticeships, this program involves a 12-week coding boot camp, studying full-time for 12 weeks to learn the basics of computers and programming before returning to work full-time for your employer to put your skills to use, then later going back to university for smaller 1-2 week blocks. 

The idea of this program really appealed to me so I applied for a couple of positions and I got 2 interviews! This was my first technical interview so I was very nervous and prepped like crazy so I could be as ready as possible. On the day I was shocked when there was little test of my technical knowledge and they were more interested in my problem solving and teamwork skills.

My first interview as a full day group interview for a larger company. We spent the morning doing various team building and reasoning challenges before planning out the requirement specification for an application. This all seemed to be going well, the interviewers were very friendly and happily chatting a joking with us. After lunch, we progressed to individual interviews where I got quizzed on some computer science basics, asked why I hadn’t completed computer science at A level and I showed my portfolio. The interview atmosphere was very unfriendly, they asked nothing about myself, my strengths and weaknesses or hobbies and just read questions off a piece of paper which felt very cold and intimidating. 

My second interview was a 90-minute individual interview for a smaller company. I was interviewed by 2 people from the company and the atmosphere was very relaxed and friendly. They asked about me, my hobbies and my skills and treated me as an individual and not a component on a conveyor belt. I was very shocked and impressed to find that they had taken the time to read my blog and look at the code on my GitHub and we had a chat about both. The way they conducted the interview was great, it flowed so nicely and we were chatting away to the point where at times I forgot I was even in an interview. They explained a lot about the company and the types of work I would be doing and then gave me a tour of the office and introduced me to staff. 

After both interviews, I compared both companies and it was clear to me which company I wanted to work for. The larger company was taking on a whole class of apprentices and was inflexible regarding holidays and working times which made it feel like a school environment, great for school leavers, but not so great for me who has been in full-time work for a few years. I felt the large group was also going to create a lot of tension and competitiveness as we would be competing for opportunities and as well as jobs at the end of the program. 

It was clear to me where I wanted to work. I wanted to work for the small company; they were really friendly, treated me as an individual and made me feel valued during my interview. I also felt that as they had a smaller team of developers and only one apprentice I would get more opportunities without having to compete. The company does a lot of varying work which appealed to me as it will give me a wider range of experience, they also meet face to face with clients which I was also keen to experience.

A few days later I heard back from both companies and was really happy when I got offered both jobs! I accepted the job from the smaller company straight away and am happy to announce that I start my new job as a Software Developer Apprentice next month!
